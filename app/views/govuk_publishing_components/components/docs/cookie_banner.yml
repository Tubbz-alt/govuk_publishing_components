  __If you are using this component within a government service, please read the [documentation on how to use the banner](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/tree/master/docs/using-cookie-banner.md).__

  Setting `data-hide-cookie-banner="true"` on any link inside the banner will overwrite the default action and when clicked will dismiss the cookie banner for a period of 365 days (approx. 1 year).

  If the examples below are not showing the banner, make sure the `cookies_preferences_set` cookie is not present or is set to false.
