  Accepts an array of breadcrumb objects. Each crumb must have a title and a URL.
  Links have tracking data but links to the homepage (any link with a url of "/") will be tracked separately as `homeLinkClicked`

  Note: By default on mobile devices, in portrait orientation, the breadcrumb will collapse to the Home and Last Sub Section
